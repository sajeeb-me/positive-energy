            <p>Welcome to Positive Energy, your number one source for all things Positive Energy Dink. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of energy drinks, with a focus on authentic, effective, energy.


                Founded in 2002 by SD Shuvo, Positive Energy has come a long way from its beginnings in Bangladesh. When SD Shuvo first started out, his passion for "eco-friendly energy drinks" drove them to action: quit day job, do tons of research, etc. so that Positive Energy can offer you "the world's most energetic soft drink". We now serve customers all over the world, and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into our own website.


                We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>


            <p className='text-center'>Sincerely,</p>
